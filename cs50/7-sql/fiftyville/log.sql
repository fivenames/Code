-- Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money."

-- In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
-- The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket."
