'''
Artificial Neural Networks models a mathematical function from inputs to outputs based on the structure and parameters of the network.
It also allows for learning the network's parameters based on data.
For eg. the activation function mentioned in machine learning: h(x) = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 is a simple neural network. It can be expressed in the form of 2 nodes connecting to 1 node,
for which the 2 nodes are input data - x1 and x2, and the other node is the output, w0 + w1x1 + w2x2.
